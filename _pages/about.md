## Hello! I'm Nesar Ramachandra

I'm a Computational Scientist at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/profile/nesar-soorve-ramachandra-0) in Chicago, where I work on developing cutting-edge machine learning and advanced statistical techniques for scientific analyses in the [Computational Sciences division](https://www.anl.gov/cps).

### Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of computational science, machine learning, and physics. I'm particularly interested in:

- **Machine Learning for Science**: Developing AI solutions for complex scientific problems
- **Cosmology and Astrophysics**: Understanding the structure and evolution of our universe
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Building probabilistic models for scientific applications
- **High-Performance Computing**: Scaling algorithms for supercomputing environments

### Professional Experience

Before my current role as a research scientist, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the High Energy Physics Division at [Argonne](https://www.anl.gov/hep/group/cosmology-astrophysics) and a [KICP Associate fellow](https://kavlicosmo.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago.

### Education
