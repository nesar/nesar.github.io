I'm a graduate student in Physics and Astronomy at the University of Kansas. I work on computational and physical cosmology, specifically on the largest cosmic structures like the Dark Matter Haloes. 

Recently I worked at Argonne National Laboratories on Deep Learning algorithms in the context of astrophysics. I use some of the largest supercomputers in the world (like Cori and Edison) to train neural networks on astrophysical data.
