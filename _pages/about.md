I'm a Physics and Astronomy PhD candidate at the *University of Kansas*. I work on computational and physical cosmology, specifically on the largest cosmic structures like the voids, pancakes, filaments and Dark Matter haloes. 

I'm also interested in implementation of statistical and machine learning tools for astrophysical data analysis. Recently I worked at the *Argonne National Laboratories, Chicago* on Deep Learning algorithms in the context of astrophysics. I use some of the largest supercomputers in the world (like Cori and Edison) to train neural networks on astrophysical data.   

Before grad school, I completed my Integrated Masters in Physics from the *Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) - Pilani, India* with an honors thesis from the *Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore.*
