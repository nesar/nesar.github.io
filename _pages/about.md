## Hello! I'm Nesar Ramachandra

I'm a Computational Scientist at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/profile/nesar-soorve-ramachandra-0) in Chicago, working on developing machine learning and advanced statistical techniques for scientific analyses with the [Computational Sciences division](https://www.anl.gov/cps).

### My Research Focus

My work spans several exciting areas at the intersection of computational science and physics:

- **Machine Learning for Science**: Developing AI approaches for complex scientific problems
- **Cosmology and Astrophysics**: Understanding dark matter and cosmic structure
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Building reliable probabilistic models
- **High-Performance Computing**: Scaling algorithms on supercomputers

### Professional Background

Before my current role, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the High Energy Physics Division at [Argonne](https://www.anl.gov/hep/group/cosmology-astrophysics) and a [KICP Associate fellow](https://kavlicosmo.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago.

In 2018, I completed my PhD in Physics and Astronomy under [Professor Sergei Shandarin](http://people.ku.edu/~sergei/) at the [University of Kansas](http://physics.ku.edu/). My research focused on computational and physical cosmology, specifically on the largest dark matter objects in the Universe.

My academic journey began at the [Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) - Pilani, India](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/physics/DepartmentofPhysics), where I completed my Integrated Masters in Physics with an honors thesis from the [Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore](https://www.iiap.res.in/).
