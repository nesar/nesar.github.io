I am a Postdoc at [*Argonne National Laboratories, Chicago*](https://www.anl.gov/hep/group/cosmology-astrophysics) working on machine learning and advanced statistics techniques for astrophysical analyses. I am also a KICP Associate fellow at the University of Chicago. 

In 2018, I finished my PhD in Physics and Astronomy under [*Professor Sergei Shandarin*](http://people.ku.edu/~sergei/) at the [*University of Kansas*](http://physics.ku.edu/). I worked on computational and physical cosmology, specifically on the largest dark matter objects in the Universe -- like the haloes, filaments and walls. I also spent the last year of grad school working on Deep Learning algorithms at the Cosmology and Advanced Computing group at Argonne.

Before grad school, I completed my Integrated Masters in Physics from the [*Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) - Pilani, India*](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/physics/DepartmentofPhysics) with an honors thesis from the [*Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore.*](https://www.iiap.res.in/)
