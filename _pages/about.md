I'm a graduate student in Physics and Astronomy at the *University of Kansas*. I work on computational and physical cosmology, specifically on the largest cosmic structures like the voids, pancakes, filaments and Dark Matter haloes. 

I'm also interested in implementation of statistical and machine learning tools for astrophysical data analysis. Recently I worked at the *Argonne National Laboratories, Chicago* on Deep Learning algorithms in the context of astrophysics. I use some of the largest supercomputers in the world (like Cori and Edison) to train neural networks on astrophysical data.
