# Nesar Ramachandra, PhD

I am a **Computational Scientist** at [Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago](https://www.anl.gov/profile/nesar-soorve-ramachandra-0) working at the intersection of **machine learning** and **scientific computing**. My work focuses on developing innovative computational methods for scientific analyses, particularly in the fields of cosmology and astrophysics.

## Current Position

At the [Computational Sciences division](https://www.anl.gov/cps) at Argonne, I develop and apply machine learning techniques to address complex scientific challenges. My work involves:

* Creating deep learning pipelines for gravitational lensing analysis
* Developing uncertainty quantification methods for scientific models
* Designing emulators for computationally expensive simulations

## Research Interests

* **Machine Learning for Science**: Developing ML methods that incorporate physical constraints and domain knowledge
* **Cosmological Structure Formation**: Understanding the formation and evolution of the cosmic web
* **Uncertainty Quantification**: Creating probabilistic models that provide reliable uncertainty estimates
* **Dark Matter Physics**: Investigating the properties and distribution of dark matter in the universe

## Background

Before joining Argonne as a research scientist, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the High Energy Physics Division and a [KICP Associate fellow](https://kavlicosmo.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago.

I completed my PhD in Physics and Astronomy at the [University of Kansas](http://physics.ku.edu/) under the supervision of [Professor Sergei Shandarin](http://people.ku.edu/~sergei/), focusing on computational and physical cosmology.

My academic journey began at [BITS Pilani, India](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/physics/DepartmentofPhysics), where I earned my Integrated Masters in Physics with an honors thesis from the [Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore](https://www.iiap.res.in/).
