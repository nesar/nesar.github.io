## About Me

I am a Computational Scientist at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/profile/nesar-soorve-ramachandra-0) in Chicago, working with the [Computational Sciences division](https://www.anl.gov/cps). My research focuses on developing machine learning and advanced statistical techniques for scientific applications.

### Research Interests

- **Machine Learning for Science**: Developing AI solutions for complex scientific problems
- **Cosmology and Astrophysics**: Understanding the structure and evolution of our universe
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Building reliable probabilistic models for scientific applications

### Background

Before joining Argonne as a research scientist, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the High Energy Physics Division at [Argonne](https://www.anl.gov/hep/group/cosmology-astrophysics) and a [KICP Associate fellow](https://kavlicosmo.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago.

I completed my Ph.D. in Physics and Astronomy in 2018 under [Professor Sergei Shandarin](http://people.ku.edu/~sergei/) at the [University of Kansas](http://physics.ku.edu/), focusing on computational and physical cosmology, especially on the largest dark matter structures in the Universe.

My academic journey began at the [Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) - Pilani, India](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/physics/DepartmentofPhysics), where I completed my Integrated Masters in Physics with an honors thesis from the [Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore](https://www.iiap.res.in/).
