## Research Highlights

### Machine Learning for Physics

I develop deep learning techniques to solve challenging problems in physics, particularly in cosmology and astrophysics. My work includes gravitational lens detection, cosmological emulation, and uncertainty quantification in scientific machine learning models.

### Computational Cosmology

I study the structure and evolution of the cosmic web through innovative computational methods. My doctoral work focused on a novel multi-stream analysis of dark matter structures, revealing new insights into the topology and geometry of cosmic structures.

### Uncertainty Quantification

Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial for scientific applications of machine learning. I develop probabilistic neural networks and Bayesian methods that provide robust uncertainty quantification for scientific simulations and data analysis.
