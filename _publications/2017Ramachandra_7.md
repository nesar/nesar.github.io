Summary: Topological connections in the single-streaming voids and multi-streaming filaments and walls reveal a cosmic web structure different from traditional mass density fields. A single void structure not only percolates the multi-stream field in all the directions, but also occupies over 99 per cent of all the single-streaming regions. Sub-grid analyses on scales smaller than simulation resolution reveal tiny pockets of voids that are isolated by membranes of the structure. For the multi-streaming e...
