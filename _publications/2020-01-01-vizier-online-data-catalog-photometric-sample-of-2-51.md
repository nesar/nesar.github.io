We selected red clump stars from the 200 million stars which have photometry from 2MASS (Cat. II/246), AllWISE (Cat. II/328), Gaia (Cat. I/345), and Pan-STARRS (Cat. II/349). We derive the Teff, logg,{DELTA} Î½, and {DELTA} P of these stars from 13 bands of photometry and parallax using a mixture density network.
