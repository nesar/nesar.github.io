Summary: We report the results of the first study of the multi-stream environment of dark matter haloes in cosmological N-body simulations in the Î› cold dark matter cosmology. The full dynamical state of dark matter can be described as a three-dimensional sub-manifold in six-dimensional phase space - the dark matter sheet. In our study we use a Lagrangian sub-manifold x = x(q,t) (where x and q are comoving Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates, respectively), which is dynamically equivalent to the dark mat...
