Summary: Deep learning generative models have demonstrated great strengths in high quality synthetic images and various scientific tasks; diffusion models learn the target distribution via a forward Markov process by gradually adding Gaussian noise to the clean sample and reversing the Markov chain via a denoising process by a neural network-based noise estimation. In this study, we generate 3-dimensional cosmological dark matter simulation data and extract density fields using cloud-in-cell methods from...
