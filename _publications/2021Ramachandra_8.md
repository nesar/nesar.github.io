Summary: Using Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) year 1 data, we perform the first k -cut cosmic shear analysis constraining both Λ CDM and f (R ) Hu-Sawicki modified gravity. To generate the f (R ) cosmic shear theory vector, we use the matter power spectrum emulator trained on COLA (COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration) simulations [Phys. Rev. D 103, 123525 (2021), 10.1103/PhysRevD.103.123525. The k -cut method is used to significantly down-weight sensitivity to small scale (k &gt;1 h Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>) modes ...
