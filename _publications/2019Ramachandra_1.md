Summary: Matter density is formally infinite at the location of caustic surfaces, where dark matter sheet folds in phase-space. The caustics separate regions with different number of streams and the volume elements change the parity by turning inside out when passing through the caustic stage. Being measure-zero structures, identification of caustics via matter density fields is usually restricted to fine-grained simulations. Here we employ a generic algorithm to identify caustics directly using the tria...
