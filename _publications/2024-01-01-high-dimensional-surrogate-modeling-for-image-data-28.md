This work presents an efficient end-to-end dimensionality reduction based surrogate modeling framework that maps high-dimensional image-like input to high-dimensional image-like output. This approach contains two modules: 1) dimensionality reduction module to reduce the input and output from a high-dimensional space to a reduced or low-dimensional space, 2) surrogate module to construct a fast and accurate input-output relationship in the low-dimensional space. In the dimensionality reduction module, both linear (principal component analysis (PCA)) and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods (kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)) are used. The hyperparameters associated with each of the dimensionality reduction methods are fine-tuned to get optimal performance of the dimensionality reduction. The input is then mapped to the output â€¦
