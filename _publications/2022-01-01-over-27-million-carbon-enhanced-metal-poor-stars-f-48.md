Summary: Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars make-up almost a third of stars with [Fe/H]<--2, although their origins are still poorly understood. It is highly likely that one type of CEMP star (CEMP-$ s $ stars) is tied to mass-transfer events taking place in binary stars, while another type (CEMP-no stars) has been suggested to be enriched by the nucleosynthetic yields of the first generations of stars. Historically, studies of CEMP stars have been explored in the Galactic halo, but more recently they have also been detected in the thick disk and bulge components of the Milky Way. $ Gaia $ DR3 has provided an unprecedented sample of over 200 million low-resolution (R $\approx $50) spectra from the BP and RP photometers. In this work, we use XGBoost to classify these spectra and detect the largest all-sky sample of CEMP stars to date. In total, we find 2,736,922 CEMP stars, with a contamination rate of 5%.
