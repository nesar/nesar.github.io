Summary: The potential of deep learning based image-to-image translations has recently drawn a lot of attention; one intriguing possibility is that of generating cosmological predictions with a drastic reduction in computational cost. Such an effort requires optimization of neural networks with loss functions beyond low-order statistics like pixel-wise mean square error, and validation of results beyond simple visual comparisons and summary statistics. In order to study learning-based cosmological mappin...
