Summary: Optical astronomical images are strongly affected by the point spread function (PSF) of the optical system and the atmosphere (seeing) which blurs the observed image. The amount of blurring depends both on the observed band, and on the atmospheric conditions during observation. A typical astronomical image will likely have a unique PSF, that is non-circular and different in different bands. At the same time, observations of known stars also give us an accurate determination of this PSF. Therefor...
