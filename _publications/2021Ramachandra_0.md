Summary: Conventionally, galaxy morphological classifications are defined by visual assessment. However, visual classification systems such as Hubble types can be intrinsically biased due to the subjective judgement of human classifiers. Additionally, since morphological "classifications" into types is an important and complementary process, it is not clear if we know what these "best types" are, such as, whether a classification scheme results in relatively unique physical properties of the galaxies or ...
