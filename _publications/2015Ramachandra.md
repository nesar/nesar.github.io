Summary: We report the results of the first study of the multi-stream environment of dark matter haloes in cosmological N-body simulations in the LCDM cosmology. At the resolution of the simulation i.e. without additional smoothing, the cosmic web represents a hierarchical structure: each halo is embedded in the filamentary framework of the web predominantly at the filament crossings, and each filament is embedded in the wall like fabric of the web at the wall crossings
