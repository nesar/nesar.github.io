Topological connections in the single-streaming voids and multi-streaming filaments and walls reveal a cosmic web structure different from traditional mass density fields. A single void structure not only percolates the multi-stream field in all the directions, but also occupies over 99 per cent of all the single-streaming regions. Sub-grid analyses on scales smaller than simulation resolution reveal tiny pockets of voids that are isolated by membranes of the structure. For the multi-streaming excursion sets, the percolating structure is much thinner than the filaments in over-density excursion approach. We also introduce, for the first time, a framework to detect dark matter haloes in multi-stream fields. Closed compact regions hosting local maxima of the multi-stream field are detected using local geometrical conditions and properties of the Lagrangian sub-manifold. All the halo particles are guaranteed to be completely â€¦
