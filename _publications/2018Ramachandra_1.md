Summary: Spatial distribution of dark matter displays a variety of intricate three dimensional structures on the largest scales in the Universe, notably the massive haloes, long tubular filaments, flattened walls and the vast under-dense voids. Galaxies embedded in the dark matter structures have illuminated the rich geometry of these structures currently known as the cosmic web. Cosmological N-body simulations are indispensable tools for understanding the evolution of the dark matter web. Recent develop...
