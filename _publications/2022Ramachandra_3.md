Summary: Photometric redshift estimation algorithms are often based on representative data from observational campaigns. Data-driven methods of this type are subject to a number of potential deficiencies, such as sample bias and incompleteness. Motivated by these considerations, we propose using physically motivated synthetic spectral energy distributions in redshift estimation. In addition, the synthetic data would have to span a domain in colour-redshift space concordant with that of the targeted obser...
