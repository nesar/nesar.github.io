Summary: Large pristine samples of red clump stars are highly sought after given that they are standard candles and give precise distances even at large distances. However, it is difficult to cleanly select red clumps stars because they can have the same T<SUB>eff</SUB> and log g as red giant branch stars. Recently, it was shown that the asteroseismic parameters, ΔP and Δν, which are used to accurately select red clump stars, can be derived from spectra using the change in the surface carbon to nitrogen ...
